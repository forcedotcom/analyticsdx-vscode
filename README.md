## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for Salesforce Analytics Extensions for VS Code: the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions for Salesforce Analytics DX.

Currently, we have the following extensions (**TBD**: change to jenkins urls when available):

- [analyticsdx-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.analyticsdx-vscode)  
   A top-level [extension pack](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest#_extension-packs) that automatically installs the following extensions for you.
- [analyticsdx-vscode-core](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.analyticsdx-vscode-core)  
   This extension interacts with the Salesforce CLI to provide basic Salesforce Analytics DX functionality.
