# Contributing

Familiarize yourself with the codebase and by reading the various [contributing guides](contributing/), particularly:

- [Developing](contributing/developing.md)
- [Coding Guidelines](contributing/coding-guidelines.md)
- [Localization](contributing/localization.md)
- [Testing](contributing/tests.md)
- [Committing](contributing/commit-guidelines.md)

Then,

1. Fork and/or clone this repository.
1. Create a _topic_ branch in your fork based on the correct branch (usually the **develop** branch, see [Branches section](#branches) below). Note, this step is recommended but technically not required if contributing using a fork.
1. Edit the code in your fork.
1. Create a pull request when you are done.

## Branches

- We work in `develop`.
- Our work happens in _topic_ branches (feature and/or bug-fix).
  - feature as well as bug-fix branches are based on `develop`
  - branches _should_ be kept up-to-date with `develop`

## Pull Requests

- Develop features and bug fixes in _topic_ branches.
- _Topic_ branches can live in forks (external contributors) or within this repository (committers).
  - When creating _topic_ branches in this repository please prefix with `<developer-name>/`.
